# Security Policy

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please contact us via email at security@example.com. You can use our [PGP public key](https://example.com/pgp-key.asc) for encrypted communication.

Please provide sufficient details when reporting a vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any other relevant information.

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and will provide regular updates on our progress. Our goal is to resolve any issues within a reasonable timeframe and maintain transparency throughout the process.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

We adhere to a responsible disclosure timeline to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively:

- Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will acknowledge receipt within 2 business days.
- We will assess the reported vulnerability and begin investigating its impact and potential solutions.
- Depending on the severity of the vulnerability, we aim to provide regular updates on our progress every 7 days.
- Once a fix has been developed and tested, we will coordinate the release of the patch with the reporter and other affected parties.
- We will publicly disclose details of the vulnerability and the patch once it has been successfully deployed to all affected systems.
